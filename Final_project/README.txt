Hi, 

In this project i am trying to build a content-based recommender system for Anime.
First and foremost, as this is my first project ever since i learnt python programming, my recommender system is not perfect and a little bit inaccurate.
But i've tried my best to get the best result.

Recommendation systems are widely used nowadays in this advanced century where quite a number of big companies applied them to improve their ratings and user satisfaction such as Youtube, Netfix, Amazon, Facebook etc. Netflix even offered a million dollars in 2009 to anyone who could improve its system by 10%.

Recommendation system can be classified into 3 groups:-

1- SIMPLE RECOMMENDER SYSTEM
2- CONTENT-BASED RECOMMENDER SYSTEM
3- COLLABORATIVE FILTERING ENGINE

I will continue my journey to learn programming not necessarily python only so i can build a perfect app in the future.

Thank you.
